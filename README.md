# Setup Arduino code (/box)

## Setup

-   Using VS Code - Arduino Extension is recommended for compiling and uploading the project
-   All dependencies to external library (excepting those core of Arduino) are included in /librairie)
-   To resolve Arduino library update the file ".vscode/c_cpp_properties.json"

## Notes

-   Using workaround to use multiple .ino files => renaming extension to .h
