# Product Vision

* Keep plant alive with minimal human intervention and alert humans when intervention is required before it is too late for the plant.

# Understanding pain point

* Taking care of a plant is demanding because you need manual operations and memory
** When was the last time I watered my plant?
** For this species what is the specification?
** You need to check if the soil is dry.
* Our head is already busy with so many things that it's easy to forget and it costs lives and then you need to deal with grief and shame.


# Features list

* Have notification when it's time to water a plant (based on time or soil dryness)
* Have warning if the plant specification is not met (not enough water, not enough light)
* Be able to control light cycle
